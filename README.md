Recycle Leather
===============

Recycle Blast is a Datapack for Minecraft that adds recipes for scrapping metal armor pieces, horse armors, tools, and rails.

Returns have been set carefully to avoid exploitation. Blasting most items will yield a significant loss compared to their crafting cost. This is just a QoL convenient way to get rid of junk items for a small return.
